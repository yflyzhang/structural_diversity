###### To execute the tutorial, make sure you have Python, R/RStudio and Jupyter Notebook installed.

To run R in Jupyter Notebook requires [IRkernel](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel). This package is available on CRAN and you can install it in RStudio Console by:


```
install.packages('IRkernel')
IRkernel::installspec()  # to register the kernel in the current R installation
```
